In this article, a brief explanation is provided about creating an interactive application that combines geographical data with powerful visualization tools. The application allows filtering points or polygons according to user needs. Additionally, the `Geocoding API` and `Street View Static API` are used to enhance the user's visual experience. As a result, it's possible to download the map with the selected filters into an HTML file, utilizing Python.
